  "dct:title": "FAIRmat Tutorial 2: Electronic Lab Notebooks and FAIR Data Management ",
  "dct:description": "This tutorial is reviewing the need of using Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) in materials science research labs, synthesis, and experimental characterization facilities. A special emphasis is put on efficiently collecting all metadata and perform a FAIR data management which not only facilitates organizing the work better and making the processes in the lab more performant, but also guarantees the possibility of data reuse via offering machine readability and machine interpretability.\n\nThe tutorial is also addressing the questions: Which kind of choices are available and how to set up such ELN system for a laboratory? A demonstration of such a lab setup will also be provided on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, three more presentations will guide you through the details of implementing such a setup for your own lab. For this purpose, we have chosen relevant, but simple use cases which can help you in mapping our strategies and solutions onto your institute.\n\nDisclaimer: NOMAD is being continuously developed based on input and feedback from the scientific community. Hence the features, services or interface may have changed since the time of recording of this video.
