  "dct:description": "Welcome to the official documentation for the NOMAD-measurements Plugin! This plugin is designed to provide structured data schemas for storing experimental measurement data in alignment with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. It serves as a community or standard plugin, offering commonly used schemas and classes/sections for measurement data that can be shared across a community.\nSupported Measurement TechniquesÂ¶\n\nCurrently, this plugin supports the following measurement techniques:\n\n    X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Supports 1D line scans and 2D Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM) scans. Supports automatic parsing of data for the following file formats (read more here):\n    Panalytical: *.xrdml\n    Bruker: *.brml\n\n    Rigaku: *.rasx\n\n    UV-Vis-NIR Transmission: Supports automatic parsing of data for the following file formats (read more here):\n\n    Perkin Elmers: *.asc\n\n    Physical Properies Measurement System (PPMS): Supports automatic parsing of measurement files and sequence files from the Quantum Design PPMS. For now, ETO, ACT, ACMS, MPMS, and Resistivity modes are supported. Supported file formats:\n    QuantumDesign PPMS: *.dat and *.seq\n\nAdditional measurement techniques are actively being developed and will be included soon, including:\n\n    Raman Spectroscopy\n    X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)\n\nStay tuned for updates as more methods become available!",
