  "dct:description": "This is one part of our first set of tutorials \"Publishing and Exploring Data with NOMAD\" and is part of the FAIRmat tutorial series.\n\nThe official NOMAD version used in this video:\nhttps://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1\n\nThe NOMAD Encyclopedia mentioned in the video:\nhttps://nomad-lab.eu/prod/rae/encyclo...\n\nThe FAIRmat tutorial: Publishing and Exploring Data with NOMAD homepage:\nhttps://www.fair-di.eu/fairmat-tutori...\n\nExercises:\n\n    Explore the various filters. For example, you could filter for titanium oxides performed with a specific code like VASP that contain density of states (DOS) data. Observe the changing amount of remaining entries when you set criteria!\n    Use visualisations and various filters to create a search for GaAs! What are the most commonly computed symmetries and used codes?\n    Use the search bar to set search criteria! Try chemical element labels to filter for certain elements! Other quantities you should try are functional names or code_names.\n    After you set a view criteria, explore the columns on the list of results!\n    Click on results to see details on the metadata! Use the ... button to go to the entry page. Look at the raw-files; preview or download files! Explore the other tabs on the entry page to go to the Processed data!\n    Explore the Processed data hierarchy for a couple of entries and compare!\n    Have a look at the underlying processed data! Click on the \"code\" icon on the top-right of each lane.\n    Also explore the NOMAD Metainfo (the schema) under the \"Analyze/The NOMAD metainfo\" menu. Explore the\n\nEntryArchive section and compare with the processed data that you saw earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: NOMAD is being continuously developed based on input and feedback from the scientific community. Hence the features, services or interface may have changed since the time of recording of this video.
