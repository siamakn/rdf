  "dct:description": "pynxtools-ellipsometry is a free, and open-source data software for harmonizing ellipsometry data and metadata for research data management using NeXus, implemented with the goal to make scientific research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).\n\npynxtools-ellipsometry, which is a plugin for pynxtools, provides a tool for reading data from (currently Woollam VASE) proprietary and open data formats from technology partners and the wider ellipsometry community and standardizing it such that it is compliant with the NeXus application definitions NXopt and NXellipsometry, which is an extension of NXopt. pynxtools-ellipsometry is developed both as a standalone reader and as a tool within NOMAD, which is the open-source data management platform for materials science we are developing with FAIRmat.\n\npynxtools-ellipsometry solves the challenge of using heterogeneous and unfindable data formats which is common in the field of ellipsometry.\n\npynxtools-ellipsometry is useful for scientists from the ellipsometry community that deal with heterogeneous data, for technology partners and data providers looking for ways to make their data FAIRer, and for research groups that want to organize their data using NeXus and NOMAD.",
