  "dct:description": "This guide provides instructions for administering a NOMAD Oasis instance. It covers essential maintenance tasks such as backing up file and MongoDB data, reprocessing uploads, re-indexing entries, and removing or inspecting uploads via the command-line interface (CLI). The guide also includes instructions for restricting user access to an Oasis, configuring performance for resource-constrained systems, and recovering from failed processing. Performance tuning options for Docker-based deployments are detailed, including limits on CPU usage, worker concurrency, and OpenMP threading.",
