  "dct:description": "pynxtools-xps is a free, and open-source data software for harmonizing X-ray photolectron spectroscopy data and metadata for research data management using NeXus, implemented with the goal to make scientific research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).\n\npynxtools-xps, which is a plugin for pynxtools, provides a tool for reading data from various propietary and open data formats from technology partners and the wider XPS community and standardizing it such that it is compliant with the NeXus application definition NXmpes and NXxps, which is an extension of NXmpes. pynxtools-xps is developed both as a standalone reader and as a tool within NOMAD, which is the open-source data management platform for materials science we are developing with FAIRmat.\n\npynxtools-xps solves the challenge of using heterogeneous and unfindable data formats which is common in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. In addition, it provides an interface for writing readers for different file formats to be mapped to NeXus.\n\npynxtools-xps is useful for scientists from the XPS community that deal with heterogeneous data, for technology partners and data providers looking for ways to make their data FAIRer, and for research groups that want to organize thier data using NeXus and NOMAD.",
